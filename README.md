# pparallel-bench

`pparallel-bench` is a command line program for parallelizing PostgreSQL's built-in `query` functionality for bulk measuring of performance data with [TimescaleDB.](//github.com/timescale/timescaledb/)
Its main use is to measure performance of queries that run against a database. The mean idea is to have one main query and to provide a CSV of data for its execution.
The Query as well as the data can be freely defined, but the first parameter of the query should be the column on which you want your results to be grouped at.

NOTE:
This Project is inspired by <https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-parallel-copy> and this project also uses its intnal DB module

## Getting started

Before using this program to bulk query data, your database should be installed with the TimescaleDB extension and the target table should already be made a hypertable.
Tutorials for this purpose can be found in the official timescaldb documentation <https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/how-to-guides/install-timescaledb/>.
If you already have a database set up you are ready to go.

## Defining the CSV file

The tool requires a csv file to be either provided via stdin or the --file parameter. Beware that all columns will be provided as parameter for the query.
Example data can look like this:

```
host_000008,2017-01-01 08:59:22,2017-01-01 09:59:22
```

but by using the -split flag you are able to provide your own seperators.

NOTE:
If you want to provide headers for your file you need to skip them with the -skip-header flag

```
hostname,start_time,end_time
host_000008,2017-01-01 08:59:22,2017-01-01 09:59:22
```

## Defining your Query

pparallel-bench can be used with any query you like, but since we are provided an input file for your query, the number of columns provided needs to match the number of parameters of the query.
if you want to provide your table name programatically through the shema and table name, your query needs to contain "%s" where the tablename is going to be placed

Example:

```
--query "SELECT time_bucket('1 minutes', ts) AS t, min(usage) AS min_cpu, max(usage) AS max_cpu,avg(usage) AS avg_cpu FROM  %s WHERE host = $1 AND ts > $2 AND ts < $3 GROUP BY t ORDER BY t DESC;"
```

but the tool acceptes any other form of query too:
Example:

```
--query "SELECT time_bucket('1 minutes', ts) AS t, min(usage) AS min_cpu, max(usage) AS max_cpu,avg(usage) AS avg_cpu FROM  public.cpu_usage WHERE host = $1 AND ts > $2 AND ts < $3 GROUP BY t ORDER BY t DESC;"
```

## Defining workers

In oder to use the power of go to query your server in parralel, this tool uses the --worker flag to define the number of concurrent workers that should query the server.
It defaults to one but can be used at will.

## Defining batches

Batches are used to limit the amout of Queries sent to your server at any given time. This brings rate-limiting and also makes this tool useable without flooding the server. Scenarios include for instance a production server that should be tested every hour for query performance but not take the entire server down while at it.
-batch-size <int> defines the Number of concurrent query executions of a worker.

## Defining the connection

this tool assumes a DB Server running on your local host on the default settings. If that is not the case a connection string can be provided using -connection  $(DBCONNECTIONSTRING)

Example:

```
-connection  "host=10.37.37.1 port=5432 user=postgres password=supersecureandmegahidden" sslmode==disable
```

## Building pparallel-bench

For Linux:
```
$ CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ./bin/pparallel-bench ./cmd/pparallel-bench/main.go
```
For Windows:
```
$ CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ./bin/pparallel-bench ./cmd/pparallel-bench/main.go
```

## Installing into $GOPATH/bin 

You can install the tool directly to your bin folder with:
```
$ go install <Thisrepourl>
```


### Using pparallel-bench

Using pparallel-bench after installation with:

```bash
# single-threaded
$ pparallel-bench --db-name homework --table cpu_usage --file foo.csv --query "SELECT time_bucket('1 minutes', ts) AS t, min(usage) AS min_cpu, max(usage) AS max_cpu,avg(usage) AS avg_cpu FROM  %s WHERE host = $1 AND ts > $2 AND ts < $3 GROUP BY t ORDER BY t DESC;"

# 2 workers
$ pparallel-bench --db-name homework --table cpu_usage --file foo.csv \
    --workers 2 --query "SELECT time_bucket('1 minutes', ts) AS t, min(usage) AS min_cpu, max(usage) AS max_cpu,avg(usage) AS avg_cpu FROM  %s WHERE host = $1 AND ts > $2 AND ts < $3 GROUP BY t ORDER BY t DESC;"

# 2 workers verbose output
$ pparallel-bench --db-name homework --table cpu_usage --file foo.csv \
    --workers 2 --verbose --query "SELECT time_bucket('1 minutes', ts) AS t, min(usage) AS min_cpu, max(usage) AS max_cpu,avg(usage) AS avg_cpu FROM  %s WHERE host = $1 AND ts > $2 AND ts < $3 GROUP BY t ORDER BY t DESC;"

# if your input file containe header you can skip them with --skip-header
$ pparallel-bench --db-name homework --table cpu_usage --file foo.csv \
    --skip-header --query "SELECT time_bucket('1 minutes', ts) AS t, min(usage) AS min_cpu, max(usage) AS max_cpu,avg(usage) AS avg_cpu FROM  %s WHERE host = $1 AND ts > $2 AND ts < $3 GROUP BY t ORDER BY t DESC;"
```

or if you rather prefer to execute the binary:

```bash
# single-threaded
$ ./bin/pparallel-bench --db-name homework --table cpu_usage --file foo.csv --query "SELECT time_bucket('1 minutes', ts) AS t, min(usage) AS min_cpu, max(usage) AS max_cpu,avg(usage) AS avg_cpu FROM  %s WHERE host = $1 AND ts > $2 AND ts < $3 GROUP BY t ORDER BY t DESC;"

# 2 workers
$ ./bin/pparallel-bench --db-name homework --table cpu_usage --file foo.csv \
    --workers 2 --query "SELECT time_bucket('1 minutes', ts) AS t, min(usage) AS min_cpu, max(usage) AS max_cpu,avg(usage) AS avg_cpu FROM  %s WHERE host = $1 AND ts > $2 AND ts < $3 GROUP BY t ORDER BY t DESC;"

# 2 workers verbose output
$ ./bin/pparallel-bench --db-name homework --table cpu_usage --file foo.csv \
    --workers 2 --verbose --query "SELECT time_bucket('1 minutes', ts) AS t, min(usage) AS min_cpu, max(usage) AS max_cpu,avg(usage) AS avg_cpu FROM  %s WHERE host = $1 AND ts > $2 AND ts < $3 GROUP BY t ORDER BY t DESC;"

# if your input file containe header you can skip them with --skip-header
$ ./bin/pparallel-bench --db-name homework --table cpu_usage --file foo.csv \
    --skip-header --query "SELECT time_bucket('1 minutes', ts) AS t, min(usage) AS min_cpu, max(usage) AS max_cpu,avg(usage) AS avg_cpu FROM  %s WHERE host = $1 AND ts > $2 AND ts < $3 GROUP BY t ORDER BY t DESC;"
```
